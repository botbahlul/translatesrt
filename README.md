### Translate subtitle files into another language
translatesrt is a simple command line tool made with python to translate a subtitle file to another language.

### Installation
If you don't have python on your Windows system you can get compiled version from this git release assets
https://github.com/botbahlul/translatesrt/releases

Just extract that translatesrt.exe into a folder that has been added to PATH ENVIRONTMET for example in C:\Windows\system32

In Linux you have to install this script with python (version minimal 3.8 ) 

To install this translatesrt, just type :
```
pip install translatesrt
```

You can try to compile that translatesrt.py script in win or linux folder to a single executable file with pyinstaller by typing these :
```
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile translatesrt.py
```

The executable compiled file will be placed by pyinstaller into dist subfolder of your current working folder, so you can just rename and put that compiled file into a folder that has been added to your PATH ENVIRONTMENT so you can execute it from anywhere

I was succesfuly compiled it in Windows 10 with pyinstaller-5.1 and Pyhton-3.10.4, and python-3.8.12 in Debian 9

Another alternative way to install this script with python is by cloning this git (or downloading this git as zip then extract it into a folder), and then just type :

```
pip install wheel
python setup.py build
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```

Then check the name of the whl file created in dist folder. In case the filename is translatesrt-0.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl then you can install that whl file with pip :
```
cd dist
pip install translatesrt-0.0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
```

You can also install this script (or any pip package) in ANDROID DEVICES via PYTHON package in TERMUX APP

https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.118.0

Choose the right apk for your device, install it, then open it

Type these commands to get python, pip, this translatesrt, (and any other pip packages) :

```
termux-setup-storage
pkg update -y
pkg install -y python
pkg install -y ffmpeg
pip install translatesrt
```
